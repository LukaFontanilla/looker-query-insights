# Looker Query Insights Extension

## Introduction

The Looker Query Insights Extension is a powerful custom visualization tool designed to summarize and present insights from any query created in a Looker explore. This extension provides a flexible and customizable interface, allowing users to tailor both the model parameters and UI to their specific needs. Inspired by [this awesome Looker Hackathon Project](https://github.com/Juventin/looker_gemini_insight), check it out!

## Features

- Custom visualization for summarized insights
- Compatibility with any Looker explore query
- Fully customizable model parameters and user interface
- Seamless integration with Looker, BigQuery, and Vertex AI
- Flexible frontend and backend architecture

## Technologies

- **Looker**: Used as the primary platform for data exploration and visualization
- **BigQuery**: Serves as the data warehouse for storing and querying large datasets
- **Vertex AI**: Provides advanced machine learning capabilities for generating insights
- Frontend: [List the main frontend technologies/frameworks used, e.g., React, TypeScript]
- Backend: [List the main backend technologies/frameworks used, e.g., Python, Flask]

## Installation

Getting started involves (in order):

1. [Backend Setup](query-insights-backend/README.md). **To note, if you've installed the Explore Assistant and have it configured in your Looker instance the Backend setup can be skipped. You can use the same backend resources for this extension**
2. [Frontend Setup](query-insights-extension/README.md)

## Usage
This Looker Extension is mounted as a Custom Visualization, meaning that once installed you can access it from any Looker Explore as a visualization offering. Additionally it provides two tabs for editing the visualization as an end user: LLM configuration & UI Customization.

### LLM Configuration

In the Explore Visualization config, the LLM tab will allow you to customize the prediction request with 3 parameters:
1. Set Model Temperature (customize variability of reponse)
2. Set Prompt Type (summary of results vs. forecast of time-series data)
3. Set Query Description/Context (pass in any additional user provided context to the prompt sent to the llm)

### UI Customization

In the Explore Visualization config, the Display tab will allow you to customize the look and feel of the visualization with 7 parameters: theme color, background color, card color, header color, shadown color, text color, and image url.
